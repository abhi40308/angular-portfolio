      Hi 👋 I am Abhijeet, currently working as a software engineer at Hasura
      <br> <br> I care about tech ⚡ in general, the pressing problems of the world 🌎, and about the impact and
      meaning of my work 🔨
      <br> <br> I have previously worked with some open source organisations 👨🏻‍💻, built a few startups 💼,
      participated in (and won) some hackathons, and had other internships and jobs, and some freelancing experience.
      <br> <br> Did a bachelors degree in engineering (Computer Science) 💻 from IIIT Kalyani, India (cost me some
      money so worth mentioning). Had a great time there, used to love competitive programming, FPS games and playing
      TT🏓 and guitar.
