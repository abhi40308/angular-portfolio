      Hi 👋 I am Abhijeet, currently working as a software engineer at Hasura.
      <br> <br> I care about tech ⚡, pressing problems of the world 🌎, and the impact and
      meaning of my work 🔨
      <br> <br> I have previously worked with a few open source organisations 👨🏻‍💻 (mainly Mifos and FOSSASIA), built
      a few projects/startups 💼,
      participated in (and won) some hackathons, and had other internships and jobs, and some freelancing experience.
      <br> <br> Completed my bachelors degree in engineering (Computer Science) 💻 from IIIT Kalyani, India.
      Had a great time there, used to love competitive programming, FPS games and playing
      TT🏓 and guitar.
